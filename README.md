The flashcard tool interface is built mainly in Javascript, using AJAX and jQuery to dynamically change the content of the page and allow the user to quickly and seamlessly interact with the flashcards.  Some features of HTML5 are used to display some of the supported types of media including video and audio.  CSS is used to structure the layout of the interface and for other aesthetic purposes such as resizing images while maintaining the aspect ratio.

The admin interface is built mainly using Javascript on the front end and PHP on the back end.  Javascript is used to maintain the content of the interface and receive input from the user, and PHP scripts on the back end receive data submissions from the user to be parsed and handled.  Through this interface, the admin is able to manage all of the files and information that is used by the flashcard tool.

XML is used to maintain all of the data used by the tool and allows for the information to be stored in a clean, easy-to-read format that can be understood even without a strong technical background.  It also provides a portable, lightweight means for storing the data so that the files are easy to move around, copy, backup, and archive.  Furthermore, these XML files are encoded in UTF-8, which supports over 110,000 different characters and allows the ability to display almost any writing system in the world.
